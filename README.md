# Regression-sprint-2307FTDS-Team-DN1
In this Repository, you will find all of our workings from the past 4 weeks relating to our Regresion Sprint Predict. 
Our final notebook can be found in the main branch under the Advanced-Regression-Starter-Data folder and covers the following: 
          
          - 1. analyse the supplied data;
          - 2. identify potential errors in the data and clean the existing data set;
          - 3. determine if additional features can be added to enrich the data set;
          - 4. build a model that is capable of forecasting the three hourly demand shortfalls;
          - 5. evaluate the accuracy of the best machine learning model;
          - 6. determine what features were most important in the modelâ€™s prediction decision, and
          - 7. explain the inner working of the model to a non-technical audience.
